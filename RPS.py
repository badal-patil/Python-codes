# The Python Random module is a built-in feature of Python. 
# At its core, a random function in Python generates pseudo-random numbers â€“ these numbers may appear random, but they are generated using a deterministic algorithm.
#  This module facilitates various random actions, including generating random numbers and selecting random values from lists or strings.
